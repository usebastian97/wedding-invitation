# Hosting Your Digital Invitation

To share your Bridgerton-inspired wedding invitation with your guests, follow these steps to host it for free and generate a QR code.

## 1. Hosting on GitHub Pages (Recommended)

GitHub Pages is a free, reliable way to host static websites.

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: If you don't have one, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com).
2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Name it something like `wedding-invitation`.
   - Set it to **Public**.
3. **Upload Your Code**:
   - You can use the GitHub Desktop app or the command line to push this project to your repository.
4. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - In your repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under **Build and deployment**, set the source to **GitHub Actions** (if using Next.js) or follow the [Next.js Deployment Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying#static-html-export).

## 2. Alternative: Vercel (Easiest for Next.js)

Vercel is the creator of Next.js and offers a seamless one-click deployment.

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
2. Connect your GitHub account.
3. Import your `wedding-invitation` repository.
4. Click **Deploy**. You will receive a unique URL (e.g., `our-wedding.vercel.app`).

## 3. Generating a QR Code

Once your website is live, you can create a QR code for your physical invitations.

1. **Copy your live URL** (e.g., `https://our-wedding.vercel.app`).
2. Go to a free QR code generator like [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) or [Bitly](https://bitly.com).
3. **Paste your URL** and download the QR code image.
4. **Test the QR code** with your phone to ensure it opens the invitation correctly.

## 4. Shortening the Link

If you want a pretty link to send via text or WhatsApp:
1. Use a service like [Bitly](https://bitly.com) or [Dub.co](https://dub.co).
2. Create a custom back-half like `bit.ly/DaphneAndSimon2026`.
